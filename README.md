## JSONFlower

JSONFlower - Beautify JSON Input is a project for learning how to implement a lexer, parser, and CLI tool (of course) with the help of GPT.

Resources:

-   **Lexer**: Inspired by [Writing a Lexer and Parser in Go](https://adampresley.github.io/2015/05/12/writing-a-lexer-and-parser-in-go-part-2.html) and [Writing a Lexer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxaD_trXwRE).
-   **Parser**: Based on concepts from _Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools_ (Dragon Book).
-   **CLI**: Built using [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), [Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss), [Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles) and [urfave/cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli)
